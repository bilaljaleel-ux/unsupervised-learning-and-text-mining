# Unsupervised Learning & Text Mining

This repository contains hands-on implementations of key unsupervised learning
and data mining concepts completed as part of my Predictive Analytics studies.

## Topics Covered

1. k-Means Clustering on Wine Dataset  
2. Hierarchical Clustering and Dendrogram Analysis  
3. Association Rule Mining (Support, Confidence, Lift)  
4. Text Mining using Bag of Words Model  

## Skills Demonstrated

- Unsupervised Learning
- Distance-based Clustering
- Feature Scaling
- Market Basket Analysis
- Association Rules
- Text Mining & NLP Basics
- Python (pandas, sklearn)

Each notebook includes clear explanations, theory, and step-by-step implementation.
